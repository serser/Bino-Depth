# Binocular Depth Setup (With 2 Intel RealSense SR300s)

Watch the vid displaying inteference here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBVFhJboZQ

As multiple Intel RealSense SR300 depth cameras interfere, only one depth camera is allowed in such setting, and I let both cameras capture color frames.

* This setting could be useful when reconstruction process requires images from binocular cameras and a depth channel.

## Dependence

* OpenCV 2.4.10
* Intel RealSense SDK 2016 r2
* Windows 10 (tested)
